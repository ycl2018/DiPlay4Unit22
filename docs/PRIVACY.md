# Privacy and diagnostics

DiPlay's product flow uses local authentication and a direct USB/Wi-Fi connection to the iPhone. No account, remote authentication service or automatic diagnostic upload is used. The iPhone's CarPlay apps have their own internet and privacy behavior.

The head unit stores app preferences, paired-device selections, pairing data and bounded diagnostic logs in app storage. Authentication and pairing material are kept out of Android backup. Uninstalling removes app-private data; exported reports in Downloads remain until you delete them.

Diagnostic export is initiated by you. Reports include app/device versions, display settings and negotiation, connection transitions, Wi-Fi band/channel and state, and decoder recovery events. The exporter filters protocol payloads, credential-bearing lines and common identifiers. Redaction cannot promise to recognize every vendor-specific string: review reports before posting them publicly. A GitHub issue is public.

On Android 9 and earlier, **Save diagnostic report** asks for storage access and saves to `Download/DiPlay`; if you decline, the fallbacks below apply. When the document picker or Downloads storage is unavailable, reports save under `Android/data/<package>/files/diagnostic-reports/` on primary external storage without requesting storage permission. The confirmation shows the actual TXT file path. The release package is `com.shihab.diplay`; debug builds use `com.shihab.diplay.hudtest`. File managers on newer Android versions may restrict access to `Android/data`; use **View** or **Share** in DiPlay instead. If external storage is also unavailable, reports save in private app storage. Each fallback location retains its newest eight exports, and uninstalling removes them. Sharing grants read access to the selected report only; nothing is sent automatically. On Android 9 and older, other apps with storage permission may be able to read the external reports.

Microphone access supports Siri and calls. Bluetooth/Nearby devices and Wi-Fi/Location permissions support discovery and transport. The optional local VPN permission supports the USB link; it does not provide a remote internet VPN.

The verified DiLink 5.1 cluster profile optionally uses Android Usage Access to follow theme and mini-map-card visibility. This permission exposes app-activity history. DiPlay filters the results to four stock BYD cluster activities, processes them locally, and logs only inferred cluster theme/visibility changes. Unrelated activity events are not retained or uploaded. Automatic mode is opt-in; disabling it stops these queries. Usage Access can also be revoked as described in [BYD navigation](BYD_NAVIGATION.md#dilink-51-theme-profile).

DiPlay checks GitHub's public release list for updates once a day and shortly after it opens. The request carries DiPlay's version in its user agent and no other data, and GitHub sees the head unit's IP address. Nothing is downloaded or installed without your tap, and **About** turns the background check off. A downloaded update is verified against its published checksum; on Android 10 and later it is also copied to `Download/DiPlay`.

The static website has no analytics script or account. GitHub Pages, GitHub and Telegram apply their own policies when you use those services.
